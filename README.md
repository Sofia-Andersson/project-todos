# To Do App [View Live &#10555;](https://todo-sofia.netlify.app)

This project is to build a To Do App to which the user can add and remove tasks, using Redux.

## The problem

- The app lists all tasks - and whether they are completed or not.
- A completed task can be marked as completed using a custom checkbox, it can also be vhanged back to uncompleted.
- Tasks can be added and deleted by using the typeform and buttons.
- A count of completed tasks and total tasks i shown underneath the list of tasks.

I started with finding a basic design to follow and draw a design plan on paper to know which components I would need, and which content were needed for those. Then I created a Tasklist, Reducer and the AddTask funtcion + set up the App.js. Then added components and content until I finally added styling.

Next steps for this project would be:
- Add a timestrap to show date and time for when each task was created.
- A button which marks all tasks completed.
- Add assortment by categories and a drop-down menu for it.
- Add a date and time- input to set a deadline for each task.
- Add filter to display completed/ not completed tasks.
